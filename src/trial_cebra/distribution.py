"""Trial-aware distributions for epoch-format contrastive sampling.

Three conditionals mirroring CEBRA's originals, lifted to trial level:

  ===============  ===============  ================  ==============================
  ``conditional``  Trial selection  Within-trial      y required
  ===============  ===============  ================  ==============================
  ``"time"``       Random           ±time_offsets     None
  ``"delta"``      delta-style      Uniform (free)    (ntrial, nd) or
                                                      (ntrial, ntime, nd)
  ``"time_delta"`` joint argmin     ±time_offsets     (ntrial, ntime, nd)
  ===============  ===============  ================  ==============================

``sample_fix_trial`` (bool, default False):
  True  — pre-compute a fixed trial→trial mapping at init (one draw per trial).
  False — re-sample target trial independently at each training step.
  Ignored for ``"time"`` (always random).

``sample_exclude_intrial`` (bool, default True):
  True  — positive samples are always drawn from a different trial (cross-trial).
  False — positive samples may come from any trial, including the anchor's own.
          For ``"delta"`` without ``y_discrete``, the trial selection switches
          from deterministic ``argmin`` to stochastic Gumbel-max sampling
          (softmax(-dists/T) with T=delta).  Pure ``argmin`` would otherwise
          collapse to "always self trial" in high dimensions because Gaussian
          noise of std ``delta`` is mostly orthogonal to inter-trial offsets
          and cannot escape self-similarity.  Stochastic selection biases
          toward similar trials but does not pin to self.  Note that even
          with this fix the resulting embedding may have limited structure
          when no ``y_discrete`` is supplied — InfoNCE benefits substantially
          from the same-class constraint that ``y_discrete`` provides.

``y_discrete`` (optional LongTensor, shape ``(ntrial*ntime,)``):
  Per-timepoint discrete class labels in flat epoch format.  When provided:

  * **Prior** (controlled by ``sample_prior``):
      - ``"balanced"`` (default): uniform over classes, then uniform within
        the selected class.  Equalises class representation in anchors but
        oversamples minority classes by ``1 / class_freq``.
      - ``"uniform"``: uniform over all timepoints; class frequency in
        anchors matches the empirical distribution.  Use this for severely
        imbalanced labels where ``"balanced"`` would distort the prior.
  * **Conditional**: same-class constraint — positives must carry the same
    discrete label as the anchor.  Falls back to unconstrained sampling for
    the rare case where no same-class candidate exists in the target pool.

``sample_prior`` only affects the anchor distribution; the same-class
conditional constraint is applied independently.

Discrete-first principle (only ``"delta"`` path):
  Following CEBRA's ``ConditionalIndex`` design, when ``y_discrete`` is
  supplied the trial-selection step uses **class-conditional** trial
  embeddings whenever possible:

    * Mode A — discrete is per-trial (constant within each trial):
      candidates restricted to trials sharing the anchor's class.
    * Mode B — discrete is per-timepoint AND ``y`` is 3-D:
      ``trial_emb_per_class[c][trial] = mean(y[trial, t]
      for t where class(trial,t) == c)``; the anchor uses its own class's
      basis to query trials.
    * Mode C — discrete is per-timepoint but ``y`` is only 2-D: a warning
      is emitted at init and trial selection falls back to class-agnostic
      ``trial_emb`` (same-class still applied at the timepoint stage).

  In all modes a tiny Gumbel perturbation is added to ``dists`` before
  ``argmin`` to break ties stochastically (e.g., when all trials share the
  same class-c embedding, as happens for pre-stim gray-screen labels).

y semantics:
  ``"delta"``      — 2-D ``(ntrial, nd)`` (per-trial) or 3-D
                     ``(ntrial, ntime, nd)`` (per-timepoint).  3-D is
                     required for Mode B class-conditional trial selection.
  ``"time_delta"`` — 3-D ``(ntrial, ntime, nd)``;  ``trial_emb = y[:, 0, :]``
                     (trial-onset embedding, no mean aggregation).

``"time_delta"`` sampling (fix_trial=False):
  For anchor (trial_i, rel_i), the candidate pool is all cross-trial timepoints
  within ±time_offsets of rel_i::

      {(trial_j, t) : trial_j ≠ trial_i, |t − rel_i| ≤ time_offsets}

  The positive is chosen as the argmin in y-space after adding Gaussian noise to
  the anchor's y query.  On static stimuli (constant y within trial) this
  degrades gracefully to delta-style trial selection + time-window sampling.

``"time_delta"`` sampling (fix_trial=True):
  Target trial is locked at init (same Gaussian-similarity query as ``"delta"``
  on trial-onset embeddings).  At each step the within-trial timepoint is the
  argmin of y-distance inside the ±time_offsets window of the locked trial.
